SQL join workshop using SQLite & the Chinook database
Setup
Download the Chinook database from https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/ .
Create folder called sql-joins-with-chinook-db in your projects folder.
Unzip the downloaded chinook.zip file in the `sql-joins-with-chinook-db` folder.
Open VS Code in the sql-joins-with-chinook-db folder.
Open the chinook database in the SQLite plugin.
Then:
* find a list of the artists in the database.
* tell me how many artists are in the database.

And here are the rest of the queries:
*  :one: Find all the artists for a given Genre
*  :two: Find the Playlist with the most / least songs (will need a group by  and count )
*  :three: Find the total for a given invoice (will need a sum)
*  :four: Find all the playlists containing a given genre
*  :five: Find the biggest/smallest invoice amounts (needs group by)
*  :six: Find the artist with the most/least songs (needs group by) (edited)
